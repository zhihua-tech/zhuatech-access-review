# ZhuaTech Access Review

> A source-available enterprise project by [ZhuaTech](https://www.zhuatech.cn/) for enterprise security, identity, compliance, and risk governance.

ZhuaTech Access Review provides a practical, self-hosted foundation for enterprise security, identity, compliance, and risk governance. It is designed for security, risk, compliance, audit, and platform operations teams, with clear business records, controlled workflows, operational visibility, and auditable actions.

This repository is intended for learning, technical evaluation, and non-commercial collaboration. The included implementation, tests, database resources, and container configuration provide a reproducible starting point for further enterprise adaptation.

**Search topics:** enterprise access review, self-hosted access review, Java Spring Boot enterprise software, digital transformation.

## Product Scope

- **Primary users:** Security, risk, compliance, audit, and platform operations teams.
- **Deployment model:** Self-hosted, with container-based local deployment where supported.
- **Governance baseline:** Role-aware operations, validation, approval boundaries, exception handling, and auditability.
- **Production boundary:** Review security, identity, backup, observability, capacity, and compliance controls before production use.

## Capability Map

- **Tenant Guard** — Manage tenant guard with ownership, validation, and explicit lifecycle states.
- **User** — Coordinate user through controlled workflows and approval gates.
- **Auth Session** — Track auth session metrics, exceptions, deadlines, and follow-up actions.
- **Business Record** — Preserve business record evidence in searchable, traceable operational history.
- **Audit Event** — Expose audit event in role-aware user and administration workspaces.
- **Idempotency Record** — Connect idempotency record to external systems through configurable integration boundaries.

## Technology Baseline

**Technology stack:** Java 21 · Spring Boot · Vue 3 · Vite · MySQL 8 · Docker Compose

### Repository Layout

- `backend/` — Java backend, domain services, APIs, validation, and automated tests
- `frontend/` — responsive user and administration interfaces
- `docs/` — architecture, operations, screenshots, and supporting documentation
- `scripts/` — repeatable local validation and maintenance scripts
- `compose.yaml` — local multi-service orchestration

## Run Locally

```bash
docker compose --env-file .env.demo.example up -d --build
```

- The demonstration environment file is for local evaluation only. Do not expose demonstration credentials to the Internet.
- Review `compose.yaml` before changing published ports, storage paths, or production credentials.

## Verification

Run the checks supported by this repository before changing or deploying it:

```bash
sh scripts/test.sh
```

## Security and Production Readiness

- Never commit real passwords, API keys, tokens, certificates, customer data, or production connection strings.
- Replace all local demonstration credentials and secrets before deployment.
- Apply least privilege, tenant isolation, backup and restore drills, monitoring, rate limiting, and vulnerability management.
- Please report security issues privately through the contact channels below instead of publishing sensitive details.
